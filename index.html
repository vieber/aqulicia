        <h2>Concept Description</h2>
        <img src="Group 24.png" alt="Visual Elements" class="concept-image">
        <p>Aquilicia is a digital interactive wallpaper designed to transform a place on the RMIT campus into an immersive underwater garden. The wallpaper explores themes of bravery and adaptation through the metaphor of flowers growing underwater, expressed in a Bauhaus-inspired style with geometric shapes as the primary visual elements. The design creates a serene yet resilient underwater landscape where flowers, symbolizing the human spirit, grow despite a harsh environment. This metaphor reflects the ability to overcome adversity and adapt, conveying a sense of hope and power.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of Aquilicia is to transform a place into a space. By providing an immersive, interactive experience, the project invites users to engage during the school time and enhance that space aesthetic in a visually compelling way. Experientially, the project aspires to evoke a sense of tranquility and reflection, encouraging users to contemplate their own experiences of resilience and transformation. Additionally, it seeks to spark curiosity, allowing users to form their own interpretations and find interest in uncovering the deeper meaning behind the wallpaper's design.</p>
        <p>The interactive wallpaper will be installed on the alcove in the attached food court area at RMIT Saigon South Campus, which serves as both a dining and transitional space for students moving between buildings.</p>
